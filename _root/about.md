In 1982, Dad bought me a Spectrum and I've been programming ever since. Went to University, got a job.

This blog is about bits and bobs I've been doing. Hopefully it'll all lead
somewhere interesting.

Feel free to [get in touch](mailto:{{ data.author.email }}) and check out
what I'm [doing for my day job](http://www.linkedin.com/in/{{ data.author.linkedin }}).
Check out the source to this blog [on github](https://www.github.com/{{ data.author.github }}). Maybe in the future I'll put some real projects up there. I might
even [start tweeting](http://www.twitter.com/{{ data.author.twitter }}).

If you _really_ like my posts, why not [subscribe to the RSS feed](/rss.xml)?
